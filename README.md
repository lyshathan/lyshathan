## Hi there 👋

I'm Ly-Sha Than, a **Software Engineer** trained at [École 42 Lyon](https://www.42.fr/), with a background in architecture. I bring a unique mix of **technical skills**, **project management experience**, and **team leadership**, developed through years leading architectural projects and now applied to software development.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Transcendance**, a real-time full-stack web application featuring chat, online games, and user management.
- 🌱 I’m continuously expanding my expertise in **C/C++**, **Unix systems**, **web development (HTML, CSS, React)**, and containerization with **Docker**.
- 👯 I enjoy collaborating in **multidisciplinary teams** and adapting quickly to new challenges.
- 💬 Ask me about **software development, system programming, full-stack web apps, or project management**.
- 📫 How to reach me: [lysha.than@gmail.com](mailto:lysha.than@gmail.com) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lyshathan)
- 😄 Fun fact: Before coding full-time, I led teams as a **project architect** and managed complex construction projects under tight deadlines.
